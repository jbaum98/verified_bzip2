                  machine-checked proofs of the functional correctness
                  of C programs. Its program logic, Verifiable C, is a
                  shallowly embedded higher-order separation Hoare
                  logic which is proved sound in Coq with respect to
                  the operational semantics of CompCert Clight. This
                  paper introduces VST-Floyd, a verification assistant
                  which offers a set of semiautomatic tactics helping
                  users build functional correctness proofs for C
                  programs using Verifiable C.}

  abstract =     {For many software components, it is useful and
                  important to verify their security. This can be done
                  by an analysis of the software itself, or by
                  isolating the software behind a protection mechanism
                  such as an operating system kernel (virtual-memory
                  protection) or cryptographic authentication (don't
                  accepted untrusted inputs). But the protection
                  mechanisms themselves must then be verified not just
                  for safety but for functional correctness. Several
                  recent projects have demonstrated that formal,
                  deductive functional-correctness verification is now
                  possible for kernels, crypto, and compilers. Here I
                  explain some of the modularity principles that make
                  these verifications possible.},
