  abstract =     {For many software components, it is useful and
                  important to verify their security. This can be done
                  by an analysis of the software itself, or by
                  isolating the software behind a protection mechanism
                  such as an operating system kernel (virtual-memory
                  protection) or cryptographic authentication (don't
                  accepted untrusted inputs). But the protection
                  mechanisms themselves must then be verified not just
                  for safety but for functional correctness. Several
                  recent projects have demonstrated that formal,
                  deductive functional-correctness verification is now
                  possible for kernels, crypto, and compilers. Here I
                  explain some of the modularity principles that make
                  these verifications possible.},

                  {B}urrows-–{W}heeler transform and a brief survey of
                  recent work on processing its output, the paper
                  examines the coding of the zero-runs from the MTF
                  recoding stage, an aspect with little prior
                  treatment. It is concluded that the original scheme
                  proposed by Wheeler is extremely efficient and
                  unlikely to be much improved. The paper then
                  proposes some new interpretations and uses of the
                  {B}urrows-–{W}heeler transform, with new insights
                  and approaches to lossless compression, perhaps
                  including techniques from error correction."
