                  for efficiently sorting large collections of
                  strings. Our implementations are significantly
                  faster than previous MSD radix sort implementations,
                  and in fact faster than any other string sorting
                  algorithm on several data sets. We also describe a
                  new variant that achieves high space-efficiency at a
                  small additional cost on runtime.",

  abstract =     {For many software components, it is useful and
                  important to verify their security. This can be done
                  by an analysis of the software itself, or by
                  isolating the software behind a protection mechanism
                  such as an operating system kernel (virtual-memory
                  protection) or cryptographic authentication (don't
                  accepted untrusted inputs). But the protection
                  mechanisms themselves must then be verified not just
                  for safety but for functional correctness. Several
                  recent projects have demonstrated that formal,
                  deductive functional-correctness verification is now
                  possible for kernels, crypto, and compilers. Here I
                  explain some of the modularity principles that make
                  these verifications possible.},

                  examines the coding of the zero-runs from the MTF

                  unlikely to be much improved. The paper then
                  proposes some new interpretations and uses of the
                  {B}urrows-–{W}heeler transform, with new insights
                  and approaches to lossless compression, perhaps
